QUESTIONS --

LRU Cache problem (this includes hash map and doubly linked list) -- very popular interview ques
Integer to Roman
Adding binary (array, string, linked list)
Multiply strings
Longest common prefix
Reverse words in String (other variation)
Iterative - Bubble, Insertion, Selection -- done
Iterative & Recursive -- Merge & Quick
Ship within days
Aggressive cows (SPOJ)
Min page allocation in book (GFG)
Painter partition (GFG)

Grid problems (doable in iterative and recursive) --
flood fill algo
max area island
surrounded regions
word search (type I & II)

Graph & recursion --
Rotten oranges
Min steps by night

Merge sort questions --
1. Count no of inversions
2. Count no less than itself

Recursion and Backtracking --
Subsets
Merge sort
Permutation
Parenthesis
Rat in a maze (GFG)
Combination Sum
Palindrome Partitioning
Letter combinations of a phone number
Inversion count (merge sort)
Count of smallest number after self (merge sort)
Integer to English word

Stack --
Daily Temperature
Stock span
next greater element
next smaller element

DP --
Maximal Rectangle

Queue --
Implement Stack using Queue (using 2 queues and 1 queue)
    in 1 queue -- approach 1: push efficient
                    approach 2: pop efficient

TIPS --

Recursion very important (heavily used in Trees, Graphs & DP)
String with dynamic programming
String with recursive backtracking
Amazon asks at least 2 Tree questions
Sum of N Natural numbers -- (N * (N + 1)) / 2

distributed transaction (2PC - two phase commit)
Internal working of Hash map (something called collision)
Hashing

Linked List -- Concepts like finding the middle and reversing the linked list will be used in medium to hard level problems (Chaman)
find middle in linked list -- runner technique aka slow and fast pointer
linked list cycle -- mathematics behind is Flocyd cycle detection

Bit Manipulation -- << is multiplication of 2, >> is division by 2
